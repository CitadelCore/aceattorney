Athena:
(Mr Wright said I could take this one all by myself...)

Matt:
Okay... come on, it's lawyer time. Ah, there you are!

Athena:
(I'm... I'm FINE!)

Matt:
Pleasure to see you again!

Athena:
They did... that... didn't they...

Matt:
Yep, you bet! Don't worry, I'm technically ex-military. I've been up longer!

Alex:
Sleep deprivation tactics ain't gonna work on me! I'm so fucking bored, though.

Matt:
Alex, please tell me your "interview" went well.

Alex:
Well... enough.

Skye:
Which means it's terrible...

Matt:
As in like, you kept yourself cool and collected right?

Athena:
I mean... Everyone cracks in interrogation. That's the point.

Athena:
Don't worry, I've kind of been there...

Matt:
Hey, worst I got was a gut punch. Thank god I'm still in this body armor suit. Long story.

Alex:
Yes. I made the prosecutor crack!

Matt:
Alex, your arrogance will be the death of us all and I mean that.

Athena:
Gumshoe isn't here yet with the video analysis machine...

Athena:
I'm worried. We may have to stall for time.

Matt:
Otherwise we're looking at... how does Japan pull executions again?

Athena:
Hanging.

Matt:
Oh.

Athena:
I kinda miss Europe...

Matt:
We're not out of this until we're all out of this.

Skye:
So our defence hinges on the video being proved fake. But, we need that machine...

Matt:
When the prosecution was showing me the footage...

Matt:
...I noticed these weird little outlines. Around our figures.

Skye:
And that's what the machine will pick up on. But we need the machine.

Skye:
And so for the machine we need more time.

Athena:
So I'm going to be honest here with you three. I will stall for time.

Matt:
Right... you got this.

Athena:
Cross exmainations that last forever, that sort of thing.

Alex:
Sounds good.

Matt:
Say, did you ever track down any of the women on that train who went after the PM's aide? The ones who handbagged him a new one.

Athena:
They're the witnesses against you.

Matt:
Oookay.

Athena:
The police offered them a deal.

Matt:
That answers that. This is gonna be an uphill battle...

Athena:
That's how it normally goes.

Matt:
No stranger to it, huh?

(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmHcDCvjB2w])

Alex:
And guys, if this all goes south, don't worry, I do have a Plan B.

Matt:
If it involves making us look any more like the bad guys than we already are, save it.

Alex:
Rather that than rotting in jail!

Athena:
Please... [https://imgur.com/CvMXKr7]

Alex:
I am filled with unbridled rage but I'm choosing to not unleash it for the time being.

Athena:
Hey that's how I feel, right now.

Matt:
I think we all are... and that might be exactly what the prosecution is counting on.

Athena:
Alright, let's get going. [https://imgur.com/cR9LgsU]

Courtroom No. 3
- Court begins from AA5

Matt:
Whew, nice place here.

Judge:
Is everyone ready? Then we shall begin the trial of... Skye Macdonald, Alex Zero, and... Matthew Ayers...

Judge:
Is the prosecution ready?

Edgeworth:
The prosecution is ready, your honour.

Judge:
...And the defence?

Athena:
The defence is ready, your honour.

- Gavel slam

Judge:
Very well, I hereby call this court to order. Prosecution, state your case.

Edgeworth:
It's a simple matter here. Decisive evidence and witnesses show that the defendants commited the crime of assault, and the crime of kidnapping.

Edgeworth:
With your permission, I will show the evidence and witnesses to the court. If it is alright, I would like to call the first witness, Detective Ema Skye, to the stand, your honour.

Judge:
Very well. Proceed.

(Ema enters the witness stand. she is wearing a lab coat and pink goggles. [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/919351124740431892/923792046861455400/unknown.png])
(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4mPHUWdgXY])

Ema:
Firstly, we were able to use CCTV to show that the cup was thrown at the aide with force, with intent to injure.

Ema:
Secondly, using DNA and fingerprint analysis, and residue in the bag and cup, we could determine that the cup was purchacsed by Matt, stored in... Ms Macdonald's bag, and then thrown by Alex Zero.

Ema:
We could also prove that the cup was thrown with enough force to seriously injure the aide.

Ema:
Furthermore, the aide was shown to be minding his own business on the CCTV. It's difficult to see what reasonable excuse to hurt someone like this would be...

(Message: `ANALYSIS RESULTS ADDED TO COURT RECORD`)
(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AQqQlQQ0-U])

Judge:
The defense may begin cross examination.

(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_sAzyTCZzQ&t])

Athena:
Very well... thank you, your honour.

Athena:
So you're saying there was no reasonable excuse to do what they did? But what if there was? Such as to stop a crime in progress?

Ema:
Well, yeah, if there was proof of that, of course.

Judge:
Order order. Defense, please continue.

Ema:
But the key thing is that, well, there isn't. As you can clearly see from the CCTV.

Judge:
Does the prosecution have evidence they wish to present to back up these claims?

Edgeworth:
Yes, your honour. Check this CCTV here, from the train.

(The CCTV evidence plays)

Judge:
I see, that does indeed seem like it matches up with your version of events... there doesn't seem to be any visible reason that they would have assaulted the Prime Minister's aide.

Athena:
(Dammit, I need Gumshoe soon... I need to stall.)

Judge:
Does the defense have a refutal?

Athena:
I uh... uh...

(Athena slams the desk [https://imgur.com/I0xuqJZ])

Athena:
I would like to present eveidence to the court!

Judge:
Very well, please present your evidence.

(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ni8yLCNTkg])

Athena:
As you can see from this video, taken by the defence, the aide was doing something extemely dodgy. Any good person would want to stop this.

Judge:
I see, that does seem like it's a sexual assault in progress...

Edgeworth:
OBJECTION! That video could very well be faked! You can't trust the defendants on this!

Athena:
OBJECTION! You'd have to prove that these videos were faked!

Judge:
Order! Order in the court!

Judge:
Now, I will ask, was this footage recorded from a device in the possession of the defendant?

Athena:
Yes, your honour. Since... um... You should be used to this after one of your previous witnesses was a robot, but in fact, one of the defendants is a robot...

Judge:
While I am not agreeing with the- come again?

Athena:
One of the defendants is a robot, your honour. Specifically Alex Zero. I am pretty sure the prosecuion can agree to its... unique physiology.

(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4mPHUWdgXY])

Judge:
I see... nevertheless, while I am not necessarily saying the claims of the prosecution are correct, due to the nature of the recording, we cannot accept it on the grounds that it's possible to have been edited by the defendant.

Athena:
However, it is also possible that the video evidence used by the procecution is not entirely kosher either, your honour.

Athena:
I would like both to be added to the court record for further analysis later on in proceedings.

Athena:
(Come on, Gumshoe...)

Judge:
This is true, but we would need an analysis of the footage to be performed to ascertain its genuineness. Are you proposing such an analysis be undertaken?

Athena:
Yes, but not at this exact time, I would like to focus on cross examining a witness from the train incident.

Judge:
Very well, would you like to call them to the stand?

Athena:
Yes, your honour.

(Emica Yokonoga is called to the stand.)

Edgeworth:
Witness, please state your name and occupation.

Yokonoga:
I am Emica Yokonoga your honor, I specialize in neural mapping technologies and work for the Japanese government.

Edgeworth:
And you were on the train in questuon, observing the incident, correct?

Yokonoga:
Correct, I was on my way to a late meeting I had been called to at my workplace.

Edgeworth:
Please begin your testimony then.

(Witness Testimony begins)

Yokonoga:
It was rush hour, I believe we were not far from Tokyo Central Station. I was facing the back of the car when I saw it... seemingly out of nowhere, that man began brutally attacking the Prime Minister's aide! I don't know why, or if he even had a reason aside from pure malice! The attacks continued until he was lying on the floor, badly beaten and unconscious. They made their getaway at Shimbashi station, off into the night.

Yokonoga:
It was not until we arrived at Shinagawa that we were able to safely get him off the train and into the care of paramedics... I fear to think what could have happened had they decided it was me who was to be the target of their sick game.

Yokonoga:
Maybe it had to do with the heinous kidnapping they had planned to commit, I don't know. All I know is, I recognize a criminal when I see one, and they are criminals beyond a doubt!

Athena:
(Wait a minute, I'm hearing some discord in her voice...)

Athena:
(She's clearly in pain from witnessing something on that train...)

Athena:
Her heart isn't matching exactly what she's saying! I believe she needs a counselling session....

Edgeworth:
But who in this court can do that?

Judge:
Is it that time again?

Athena:
Yes, it's that time again.

Edgeworth:
Are... Are you SERIOUS?!

(Athena has opened a program on her holographic computer)
(Music plays: [https://youtu.be/YPB7izLB8LY])

Athena:
...When you say you saw the aide get attacked, you... Felt happy?

Yokonoga:
No, no not at all! It was a... heinous crime. I don't know why you'd insinuate such a thing.

Athena:
I'm sorry, but i think I can understand why you were happy.

Yokonoga:
Happy? What on earth are you talking about?

Athena:
And, your honour, I think we're still doing the therapy right now...

Athena:
I'm pretty sure she was a uh... Victim, in this case.

Judge:
A victim? What do you mean?

Athena:
A victim of inappropriate behaviour, your honour.

Athena:
Any woman in that situation would feel happy when they saw the perpetrator got their just desserts.

(Edgeworth makes a face: [https://64.media.tumblr.com/2803b8bc31f5d8f4087364a2cfa7b321/f323a66d57996b3a-ab/s400x600/eeab985dc86f0c4f4bf09e32f51417806387babd.gifv])

Yokonoga:
Yes... yes, it's true. The aide was touching me inappropriately at the time the beating took place...

Yokonoga:
However! That does not excuse the disproportionate response they gave! I can understand a slap, maybe even restraining. But this man was beaten until he was unconscious! I think I speak for everyone in this courtroom when I say, vigilante justice has no place in our modern society! The footage, your honor, it misses the inappropriate touching, but everything else is real.

Athena:
(Damn girl, can you please admit to the truth already...)

Yokonoga:
Couldn't see something like that in a train that crowded, but you can certainly see just how hard they went down on him!

Athena:
I would like to continue the cross examination.

Judge:
You may, go on ahead.

Athena:
Skye, Alex, Matt... Do you have any idea what part of her testimony we can tackle next? Something is definitely fishy here...

Matt:
Ah shit... I... don't know. They admitted the part where it was out of the blue was phony, but until we can prove that footage is falsified, for all they know we did beat them unconscious...

Athena:
I'll just press her.

Athena:
So what exactly happened after the defendents left? Can you provide any more details?

Yokonoga:
Well, after that, someone adjacent to me made a phone call to the paramedics to come pick him up at a later station.

Athena:
(Let's see if she slips up at all...)

Athena:
Out of curiosity, why didn't you make the phone call...

Yokonoga:
I believe she is among the witnesses called to the court, you can ask her, she can verify.

Yokonoga:
Well... you see, while I was initially happy, seeing the beating was rather shocking...

Yokonoga:
I didn't know what to do, it was her who first suggested to call an ambulance. I would have had I had more time to recover... but she beat me to it.

Athena:
I see.

Athena:
(Hmmm... What do I do now...)

Yokonoga:
I'm sure you have their telephone records on file, you can see it clear as day!

Athena:
(Do I see if I have any evidence, or try to push her more...)

Yokonoga:
It was... yes, Yurakucho where she made the call I think.

Athena:
Wait a second... But that station she mentioned...

Athena:
It's different to the station she mentioned earlier. I don't know what this means... but...

Athena:
[https://tenor.com/view/athena-cykes-athena-cykes-ace-attorney-objection-gif-21393769]
OBJECTION! You contradicted yourself.

Yokonoga:
What? What do you mean?

Athena:
Earlier you said that it was... Shinagawa where you got him off... But now you're saying this?

Yokonoga:
Well, as you can imagine I was under a bit of duress! What with the late meeting and all... I must have forgotten.

Athena:
Then I think we'd all like some hard evidence to figure out what's the truth here.

Athena:
(Come on bluff, don't fail me now...)

(Train details added to court record)
(Call records added to court record)
(Paramedic record added to court record)

Yokonoga:
Yes, I do apologize to the court... but, there are records of all this that can speak the truth better than my memory can.

Athena:
(Now what...)

Yokonoga:
I think if any of us were called to a late meeting of high importance, were sexually assaulted, and watched a man be brutally beaten, we'd get details mixed up too.

Athena:
HOLD IT! The call was made 5 minutes after the train departed...

Athena:
It's all in the evidence!

Yokonoga:
But- I- wha- you- they- we-

Yokonoga:
Okay fine, I admit it! They didn't knock the man unconscious at all! Maybe injured, but not enough to put them out cold!

Yokonoga:
When that man there screamed that he was a pervert, we took our shot. Me and the other women all hit him repeatedly with our handbags, and, well, we didn't realize he was out until he collapsed to the floor.

Yokonoga:
Maybe you could justify a small assault charge, but not with the severity that was originally carried.

Yokonoga:
Frankly I doubt they even knew the identity of the man. After all, they're all a bunch of foreigners who presumably only care about Western politics, why would they recognize one of our officials? I bet they don't even know who the Prime Minister is.

Yokonoga:
Look at them, barely able to speak a lick of Japanese, except for Google Translate over there, it's not even that great. Let me tell you, it is-

Judge:
Witness, please spare us personal attacks, it gets us nowhere.

Skye:
(I'd recognise the bloody prime minister at least...)

Judge:
But if this is true, what does the prosecution have to say about the contents of those videotapes? I saw what seemed to be an assault by them alone, this tag team of vigilante women with handbags was nowhere to be seen.

Judge:
Does the prosecution agree with or reject the claims by the witness that the footage is an inaccurate version of events.

Edgeworth:
It... Seems that there is inadequacy of the footage... For the train video.

Edgeworth:
Ema, look forward to your next salary review...

Matt:
Ouch!

Edgeworth:
I will... Drop the case on the attack on the prime minister's aide...

Edgeworth:
And... Go onto the much less defendable incident of kidnapping.

Judge:
Very well, let the record show the court has decided to downgrade the charge to a much less serious offense.

Edgeworth:
And I'll show you how worthless your lawyer is!

Judge:
Does the prosecution wish to call a witness to the stand?

Edgeworth:
Yes! Detective Gumshoe has been getting restless locked in the lobby. I didn't trust him wandering around....

Matt:
Uh oh.

Judge:
Excuse me, did I hear correctly that Detective Gumshoe is locked in the lobby?

Edgeworth:
er... Yes, your honour. For his safety.

Judge:
Well, Mr. Gumshoe does have a tendency to get into trouble...

Athena:
(Gumshoe no...)

Judge:
I will overlook it for now.

Athena:
(He can't give us that tool... we're screwed...)

Athena:
(All this stalling for nothing...)

Judge:
Well, let's let the detective in now.

(the door to the courtroom swings open)
(in walks the detective, carrying a funny looking tape player)
(on the side it reads)
(NAVITRON Computer Aided Video Playback Device)

Judge:
Is that the device you intend to conduct the videotape analysis with?

Judge:
Ah, it's one of the new Navitrons. I have one at home, best tape player I ever had.

Judge:
Now, does the defense wish to begin its examination of the tapes?

Athena:
Uh... If that's allowed, then yes.

Judge:
Very well, the defense may begin their analysis of the evidence presented by the prosecution.

Athena:
Uh.... Should we start with the train one, as we know it's been altered?

Judge:
The defense may begin with any tape they see as fit to forward their case.

Judge:
Detective, you do know how to use one of these, correct?

Athena:
Uh...

Judge:
Detective, please tell me you can work one of these...

Matt:
We're so screwed.

(the colour drains from Athena's face)
(her necklace shuts down in dispair)

Skye:
Gumshoe... Pls....

Athena:
Gumshoe... Your.. Pocket...

Judge:
Um, there's a... spare television in the corner with a VCR if you wish to watch the video.

Judge:
Prosecution, who would you like to call to the stand?

Edgeworth:
I call... the chief of Kuiser security, to the stand.

Judge:
Prosecution, your witness of choice seems to be unavailable at the moment, would you like to call someone else up instead?

Edgeworth:
Very well, I call one of the officers present at the scene... uh... oh no not him...

Edgeworth:
Officer... Mike... Meekins...

Matt:
What's up with that guy? These witnesses are... something.

Meekins:
Thank you sir, I would have been here sooner but... delays.

Meekins:
They're insane I tell you! Insane! I was there at the tower and let me tell you they are unhinged!

Meekins:
I remember when we made the arrest, they were attempting to help an accomplice into the vent.

Meekins:
When we began to pull them out, they kept pulling! We told them to stop, but they refused! Harder and harder until they passed out from the trauma!

Meekins:
And then, oh, and then! That one had the audacity to accuse us of being the reason behind their injury! He threatened us, said he would kill us-

Athena:
HOLD IT!

Athena:
I think a proper testimony is in order here, your honour. To allow for proper cross examination, following court procedure.

Judge:
I agree. Witness, please take the time to compose yourself and we will begin the testimony again.

Meekins:
I do apologize your honor... yes, yes I'm ready now.

Judge:
Very well. Witness, start from the beginning.

(Witness Testimony begins)
(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KbWogucWNs])

Meekins:
It was sometime before midnight, past 11. We had received word that there had been an assault at the train station. Then, a distress call from the tower. I headed along with my fellow officers and we began to make our way to the tower floor. He was already there he says, gesturing towards the Helios guard, said they had found cellular signals from the suspects. Personally, I think we could have done it fine without his help.

(look of disappointment)

Meekins:
Then, we found the kidnapped girl. She was lying on the ground, only semi conscious. I dread knowing what they might have done to her. Suddenly, we heard a noise from the server room. Thinking fast, we entered the room, to find the suspects attempting to help an accomplice into the vents.

Meekins:
We grabbed them and instructed the suspects to let go. However, they refused! They continued to pull and pull, despite their accomplice very clearly showing signs of distress! They passed out from the trauma, after which we were able to successfully get them out of the vents.

Meekins:
And then... then, when we instructed the remaining suspects out of the vent, you should have seen it! They were noncompliant, instead making motions to fight us! I remember that one there he points towards me had a sidearm, a small automatic pistol. My department has brought it to the court for the prosecution's use.

(Automatic pistol added to court record.)

Alex:
(Hits the table so hard it dents the metal.)
You have got to be KIDDING me! You're going to blame ME for what you did to Skye?!

Alex:
You're bastards, every last one of you. You sicken me.

Judge:
Order! Order in the court!

Athena:
Alex, please... Let me do my job...

Judge:
I ask the defense, do not speak over the witness.

Athena:
...Can I begin my cross examination now...?

Judge:
Is the witness finished?

Meekins:
No sir, there are a few last details.

Athena:
Very well.

Meekins:
That man there, the holder of the pistol, drew it and attempted to fire upon me and my fellow officers. We were able to restrain them and wrestle the handgun away from them before they could do any harm, luckily.

Meekins:
But! It does not end there! That one there, the one who just had the nerve to speak over a testimony session... oh, you should have seen them! Foaming at the mouth, raving, swearing, making gestures that I will not demonstrate in good company! He said he would "kill us all for what we did", clearly placing the blame on the injury of their accomplice on us, rather than their refusal to comply! I summoned a special weapons team to the site, but someone was able to subdue them with a specialized weapon, owing to their nature.

Meekins:
That is all, your honor.

Athena:
...

Athena:
ow...

Athena:
May I begin my cross examination?

(Cross Examination begins)

Athena:
> That man there, the holder of the pistol, drew it and attempted to fire upon me and my fellow officers. We were able to restrain them and wrestle the handgun away from them before they could do any harm, luckily.
...You say that he "drew the gun and attempted to fire".

Athena:
Do you have any proof to assert your claim?

Meekins:
Yes, I do as a matter of fact. If you'll refer to the firearm we presented as evidence, you'll note the fingerprints.

Meekins:
Our forensic analysis, while it cannot exactly pinpoint the time the prints were made, indicates they were fresh.

(Gun Updated in the court record)

Athena:
Uh... about this gun... It looks fired recently?

Athena:
But a gun wasn't fired at that time...

Matt:
Funny story! We encountered a rogue elevator in the first building we came to.

Matt:
They had all the emergency equipment taken out so... I did a bit of forceful problem solving.

Athena:
Where is this building? is the bullet still there?

Matt:
The building... what was the name...

Matt:
You said it was a "Arcturus Building" when we first met, right?

Athena:
Something like that...?

Matt:
Yeah! Something like that. I'll bet the bullet is still there.

Athena:
(Slaps the desk)
The defence maintains that the gun was not drawn at the time of the defendants' arrests!

Meekins:
Whaaaa?

Athena:
In fact, the gun was discharged at an elevator on the other side of the city!

Athena:
The defence would like the bullet retrieved and analysed.

Athena:
...uh... The addresss is... shown by... the destination of this call, the "Arctarus" building.

Judge:
Very well. This will be analysed in due course. Defence, please continue with your cross examination...

Athena:
(...really?!)

Matt:
There's gotta be something else we can pick apart...

Athena:
Okay...

Athena:
> But! It does not end there! That one there, the one who just had the nerve to speak over a testimony session... oh, you should have seen them! Foaming at the mouth, raving, swearing, making gestures that I will not demonstrate in good company! He said he would "kill us all for what we did", clearly placing the blame on the injury of their accomplice on us, rather than their refusal to comply! I summoned a special weapons team to the site, but someone was able to subdue them with a specialized weapon, owing to their nature.
What... exactly... did... it... say?

Meekins:
Well, first it exclaimed "what the- did you do to her?"

Meekins:
I won't repeat the expletive used as this is a polite gathering.

Meekins:
Next, it threatened to, in his words, kill every last one of us.

Meekins:
It said we'd be "given a chance" to let her go.

Meekins:
Around then, one of... the guards showed up with a special weapon.

Athena:
(...why...)

Alex:
Your honour, even though the threat may have been there, it was in self-defense only. For all I knew, my friend was about to be seriously injured or even killed.

Judge:
Defense, please. The time for questions will come.

Athena:
(...this is pain)

Athena:
So this weapon was used, and Alex was unconsious.

Athena:
And so Matt then surrendered?

Meekins:
Not in the slightest, we had to wrestle them down so they couldn't use their weapon.

Athena:
(turns to Matt) Please don't tell me that you..

Meekins;
It was quite a struggle until we were able to get it from him!

Meekins:
You have my word, I never touched that weapon. I did exactly as they instructed.

Athena:
...hmm... (she flicks her earring)

Athena:
Interesting...

Meekins:
See, while the gun may have been used earlier, the fingerprints suggest it well could have been used after the initial drawing earli.

Athena:
...Is there CCTV?

Athena:
Though it could very well have been modified...

Matt:
Wait a second. They said it was a struggle...

Athena:
...A struggle!

Matt:
We need to take a closer look at the exact print patterns.

Athena:
Yes. Is detective Ema Skye still here?

Athena:
I would like her to go over the fingerprints in detail for the court.

Judge:
Yes, as a matter of fact.

Ema:
Here's a report of the prints, your honour.

(Fingerprint report added to the court record)

Matt:
What do we have...

(Music plays: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4mPHUWdgXY])
(The report shows two prints belonging to one of the officers at the scene, a two fingered grip on the gun's rear.)
(Additionally, prints on the grip and trigger belonging to me, suggesting a conventional handling of the weapon.)

Athena:
...Mr Meekins...

Athena:
Please see this evidence?

Meekins:
Yes, it's perfectly- whaaa?

Athena:
(Winces) Please... don't use that megaphone...

Meekins:
Okay fine! I admit it!

Meekins:
They willingly surrendered to us and we removed the weapon after they had been cuffed!

Alex:
Oh my god. You're literally lying and withholding evidence.

Athena:
This is perjury, but that never gets punished here, does it...

Meekins:
However it's clear their compliance only came when they were threatened, I maintain they had been noncompliant prior to their accomplice being incapacitated.

Athena:
I uh... would like to continue the cross-examination...?

Judge:
(Stern look) Do not lie to us, witness.

Alex:
Your honour, I request you declare the witnesses evidence invalid due to perjury and evidence contamination admitted by the witnesses themselves!

Matt:
Alex please. This is the lawyer's job.

Athena:
Alex, while I like your enthusiasm, it doesn't work like that here.

Athena:
But I will proceed to demolish as much as possible. (She cracks her knuckles)

Judge:
Order! Defendant, if you cannot stop speaking out unduly, I will request the remainder of the trial be postponed until tomorrow.

Athena:
(why...)

Athena:
> We grabbed them and instructed the suspects to let go. However, they refused! They continued to pull and pull, despite their accomplice very clearly showing signs of distress! They passed out from the trauma, after which we were able to successfully get them out of the vents
Can you please clarify these sequence of events?

Meekins:
Yes ma'am. When we entered the room, they were hoisting their accomplice into the vents with some kind of cable. We grabbed their leg and instructed them to let go, I assume someone was holding onto them as opposed to vice versa.

Meekins:
However, despite clear instructions they continued to pull. It took at least 3 other officers and numerous requests they surrender themselves to counteract the pull. I presume someone in there was pulling with the strength of many men.

Meekins:
All the while their accomplice verbally expressed distress, saying they couldn't take it. We begged them to let go, but they continued to pull. Then, when she finally passed out, they complied and let her free.

Meekins:
Despite numerous attempts by them to claim we are to blame, it was their own refusal to comply and decision to fight an unwinnable battle that led to her injury, but they refuse to admit this in any capacity

Skye:
Uh...

Athena:
HOLD IT! What exactly was siad in that exchange?

Meekins:
Hm, let me jog my memory, if you don't mind.

Alex:
(Is clearly looking extremely exasperated doing everything short of speaking out)

Meekins:
Well, first we grabbed them and told them to freeze. They screamed as they began to be pulled two ways. As they pulled harder I requested assistance, and requested the suspects to let go. They began to express distress, they said they couldn't keep going. As more officers arrived to pull we continued to beg them to let go. They said they couldn't handle this, and then passed out. After which, we retrieved them from the vent.

Athena:
How was this pulling facilitated?

Athena:
As in... was Skye holding something, or being held?

Athena:
In addition, how can we trust what you've said about your words and precise actions?

Meekins:
There was a cable wrapped around them, yes, that was it.

Meekins:
And I understand I may have erroneously remembered events from earlier but I assure you, this is a truthful recollection.

Athena:
Hmm...

Skye:
I may have wrapped the cable around myself...

Skye:
I told them to let go... but hm...

Matt:
Well we know they sure didn't instruct us to let go...

Matt:
I said to let go but, they never did

Skye:
I said "I can't keep going". that's it.

Matt:
Hmmm... There's gotta be a way we can make it anything that's not our word against theirs.

Skye:
CCTV would be doctored by them.

Alex:
I've got video but they'll just dismiss that as a fake.

Matt:
What we really need is someone who was there who is not only willing to say what really happened, but who they trust.

Skye:
Gumshoe only came in during the aftermath. The victim, maybe?

Matt:
And the Helios guard came in after they had already been taken from the vents...

Skye:
We need the victim to testify...

Matt:
Speaking of, does the court have a list of witnesses to be called?

(Athena shows the list)

Matt:
Huh... The victim isn't on here.

Matt:
You'd think they'd want someone like that to aid their case.

Athena:
Officially, the reason is to "avoid greater distress".

Athena:
However, I do smell something is up here, since there isn't even a statement from her in the record.

Matt:
Odd... I imagine us pointing it out wouldn't do us much good though. We'd need them here in person.

Matt:
Say, I had a thought. That guard is on this list. The police weren't exactly kind to us, but they weren't exactly kind to them either...

Athena:
The defence would like to hear the HELIOS Guard's testimony.

Judge:
Very well, is the witness done with their testimony?

Meekins:
Yes, your honour.

Judge:
The defense may proceed.

Meekins:
Wait wait wait!

Judge:
Make it quick, please.

Meekins:
You all may distrust me after my faulty recollection of the firearm, and you may think my description of the events leading up to the arrest is faulty as well, but if there's one thing that I can attest to beyond a reasonable doubt, it's that that machine is mad! Mad I tell you!

Meekins:
But don't take my word for it, take its.

Meekins:
We authorized for release this VHS tape detailing its interview with the prosecution. The prosecution may request it played at any time they wish.

Judge:
Is that all?

Meekins:
Yes your honor, I cede the stand to the defense.
(Interrogation tape added to court record.)

Athena:
(...oh fuck.)

(The Helios Guard arrives at the stand)

E-21864:
Greetings, your honour. My name is E-21864, and I represent the HELIOS Tokyo Local Operations Authority.

Judge:
That's quite a name, is that official?

E-21864:
Yes. May we begin?

Athena:
(...great, another robot.)

Athena:
(does it feel emotions? or was that work put to waste...)

Judge:
Yes, you may begin your testimony.

E-21864:
I was notified at approximately 3:22pm local time of an incident by local police involving several individuals at the Arctarus building. I arrived at said building at 3:34pm, where I was briefed with haste by officers and witnessed a standoff taking place in a utility server room between three individuals and seven police officers. One of the individuals... he points to Alex... was immediately identified to be a machine of Kuiser design with serial 280021. This serial, oddly enough, is not in any database we hold. 

E-21864:
Regardless, this individual was a machine and property of Kuiser, owned by HELIOS, which subsequently falls under our jurisdiction. The machine has clearly malfunctioned and gained self-control, something we have safeguards against. With authorisation from HELIOS High Command, I used a weapon to temporarily neutralise the malfunctioning machine. Rest assured, sir, that our engineers will look into this discrepancy as soon as possible.

E-21864:
And as this individual is not a human but a Kuiser machine, it constitutes our legal property and may not be charged with any offence. Our legal department is preparing the proper documentation as I speak, but we will require you to hand it over to us for proper decommissioning and root cause fault analysis.

Judge:
That does complicate things a bit... however if you are able to present the proper legal documentation and it's found to comply with all applicable local laws and statutes, I will drop all charges against the mechanical individual and have them turned over to your business.

E-21864:
Thank you. I've been advised that it won't be much longer until the paperwork is ready. Do you have any further questions for me?

Judge:
That would be the duty of the defense. If your statement is complete, then they may begin their cross examination.

E-21864:
My statement is complete.

Judge:
Very well, the defense may begin their cross examination.

Matt:
Shoot... what are we gonna say?

Alex:
I can't believe this... he wants to... take me to be decommissioned?!

(Cross Examination begins)

Athena:
> One of the individuals... he points to Alex... was immediately identified to be a machine of Kuiser design with serial 280021. This serial, oddly enough, is not in any database we hold. 
OBJECTION! I'm sorry but did you say "This serial, oddly enough, is not in any database we hold."

Athena:
As much as it would be convenient for you, this makes the very foundation of your claim shaky.

Athena:
In addition, you have described him as gaining sentience, if that is the case, then a very different set of legal rules would apply than that of mere property.

Athena:
A similar situation was discussed in court by my Boss, Pheonix Wright.

Athena:
(Please judge... please accept this...)

Athena:
(I don't want to have to fight two legal battles at once...)

Judge:
The defense is correct. Our country is a pioneer of human computer interfacing, and as such we have a very different set of laws in place to accommodate these entities.

Judge:
If true sentience can indeed be proven on the part of the defendant, they have the same trial rights as the other defendant.

E-21864:
Your honour, with all due respect. If the unit is what it appears to be, then it may be a highly advanced military prototype that, left unchecked, could put many lives severely in risk, especially considering how unpredictable it is. The only way to keep the public safe is for it to be safely decommissioned under our care.

E-21864:
The Japanese Ministry of Defense has advised me that it is critical that we recover the unit.

Judge:
I understand, and evidence so far has demonstrated that that is in all likelihood the case, but the law stands as it is written.

Judge:
Additionally, if you have any official statements on the matter I request they be presented at your soonest convenience.

Matt:
Hey, something else. Did it say 3 PM?

Matt:
The officer earlier said the call came in around 11... something is amiss.

Matt:
Besides, it was dark out at the time of the incident so regardless of the time, it couldn't have been the case.

Athena:
...

Athena:
(Presents the call logs.)
How did you know of any indicent involving this group, when we can prove they were there long after 3pm?

E-21864:
(makes a face of confusion)
Huh? My times should be accurate...

Athena:
Was there another incident at 3:22pm?

E-21864:
Not that I know of... I only recall one incident.

Athena:
...

Athena:
...

Athena:
Wait. Where did you come from?

E-21864:
Helios Local Operations Base Alpha, Fugoyaka.

Athena:
What is your current internal clock?

E-21864:
6:10pm?

Matt:
Wait a minute, that's not right!

Matt:
Their clock would be slow, not fast.

Matt:
It's definitely not past 6 PM!

Skye:
What do you mean?

Matt:
So if they said it was 3, and the incident was in actuality around 11...

Matt:
They'd be behind by 8 or so hours. But now it sounds like they're ahead... It's 11:02 AM right now.

Athena:
Wait... Pheonix's case files had something similar? Something about a clock...

E-21864:
My clock is accurate. There's no way to compromise it.

Matt:
I hope it doesn't believe it's actually past 6 PM! The sun is still up.

E-21864:
Look, I believe what my systems tell me.

Skye:
What if it was like offset by a large number?

Matt:
Hmmm. Believes what its systems tell it... that might explain it.

E-21864:
Would you disregard your mind?

Matt:
Hey I took a philosophy class in college, don't get me started.

Athena:
It's common in computers to check an external clock source in addition to an internal real time clock.

Skye:
(Nods)

E-21864:
Your point being?

Athena:
Something is up with your clock.

E-21864:
...

E-21864:
How do you explain that? Never once has a unit, including me, experienced a clock failure. It hasn't happened.

Matt:
How often do they synchronize with an external time server, and do they know it's the same one every time?

E-21864:
Like all others, I synchronise to Kuiser's satellites approximately every five minutes.

Skye:
Right... Is something up with the satellites then?

E-21864:
If the satellite was an impostor, an alarm would be triggered.

Athena:
What about timezones? 

E-21864:
Elaborate?

Athena:
Could you be set for a different timezone?

E-21864:
Well... my current timezone is UTC.

Athena:
Can you give us the current time converted to local time, please?

E-21864:
Apologies, Error 1982? Uh...

Judge:
Is everything okay?

E-21864:
I may need a moment to get an issue fixed.

Athena:
...

Athena:
Alex, since you seem to be similar model, does the error code match anything at all?

Matt:
Someone's gonna get fired for all this...

(Awkward moments pass)

Matt:
It's just... kinda sitting there?

Skye:
Uh...

Judge:
If the witness doesn't restore themselves to functionality within the next 15 seconds I will ask the defense to call them away from the stand.

Athena:
...you've got to be kidding me...

Judge:
In fact, we've been here long enough that I'm getting ready to call it for the day, if neither party objects.

Athena:
...

E-21864:
Apologies, technical difficulties.

E-21864:
As I was-

E-21864:
Error.

Athena:
Oh dear.

E-21864:
Core system breach. 15 minutes to failsafe self destruct.

Athena:
WHAT THE FUCK.

Athena:
SOMEONE RING HELIOS, RIGHT NOW!

Judge:
Okay everyone, please remain calm! Proceed to the exits in an orderly fashion...

E-21864:
Attention. This is not a test. Self destruct sequence in progress. Contact HELIOS immediately if this sequence was initiated in error.

Matt:
Jesus Christ...

Skye:
Prosecutor, surely you can call Helios... Please...

Skye:
And this is a KUISER-style self destruct, so fusion batteries... This city will be leveled.
