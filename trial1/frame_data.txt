(Mr Wright said I could take this one all by myself...)

matt.normal:
Okay... come on, it's lawyer time. Ah, there you are!

athena.fann:
(I'm... I'm FINE!)

matt.sad:
Pleasure to see you again!

athena.fcc:
They did... that... didn't they...

matt.happy:
Yep, you bet! Don't worry, I'm technically ex-military. I've been up longer!

alex.normal:
Sleep deprivation tactics ain't gonna work on me! I'm so fucking bored, though.

matt.normal:
Alex, please tell me your "interview" went well.

alex.normal:
Well... enough.

skye.normal:
Which means it's terrible...

matt.normal:
As in like, you kept yourself cool and collected right?

athena.fn:
I mean... Everyone cracks in interrogation. That's the point.

athena.fn:
Don't worry, I've kind of been there...

matt.looking:
Hey, worst I got was a gut punch. Thank god I'm still in this body armor suit. Long story.

alex.normal:
Yes. I made the prosecutor crack!

matt.angry:
Alex, your arrogance will be the death of us all and I mean that.

athena.fcc:
Gumshoe isn't here yet with the video analysis machine...

athena.fcc:
I'm worried. We may have to stall for time.

matt.looking:
Otherwise we're looking at... how does Japan pull executions again?

athena.fcc:
Hanging.

matt.looking:
Oh.

athena.fann:
I kinda miss Europe...

matt.normal:
We're not out of this until we're all out of this.

skye.normal:
So our defence hinges on the video being proved fake. But, we need that machine...

matt.normal:
When the prosecution was showing me the footage...

matt.looking:
...I noticed these weird little outlines. Around our figures.

skye.normal:
And that's what the machine will pick up on. But we need the machine.

skye.notlooking:
And so for the machine we need more time.

athena.fcon:
So I'm going to be honest here with you three. I will stall for time.

matt.normal:
Right... you got this.

athena.fn:
Cross exmainations that last forever, that sort of thing.

alex.normal:
Sounds good.

matt.looking:
Say, did you ever track down any of the women on that train who went after the PM's aide?

matt.looking:
The ones who handbagged him a new one.

athena.fn:
They're the witnesses against you.

matt.looking:
Oookay.

athena.fn:
The police offered them a deal.

matt.looking:
That answers that. This is gonna be an uphill battle...

athena.fann2:
That's how it normally goes.

matt.normal:
No stranger to it, huh?

music, prelude
alex.normal:
And guys, if this all goes south, don't worry, I do have a Plan B.

matt.normal:
If it involves making us look any more like the bad guys than we already are, save it.

alex.normal:
Better than rotting in jail!

athena.fann:
Please...

alex.normal:
I am filled with unbridled rage but I'm choosing to not unleash it for the time being.

athena.fh:
Hey that's how I feel, right now.

matt.looking:
I think we all are... and that might be exactly what the prosecution is counting on.

athena.fcon:
Alright, let's get going.

Firstly, we were able to use CCTV to show that the cup

was thrown at the aide with force, with intent to injure.

Secondly, using DNA and fingerprint analysis, and residue in the bag and cup...

es.n:
we could determine that the cup was purchacsed by Matt, stored in...

es.n:
Ms Macdonald's bag, and then thrown by Alex Zero.

es.n:
We could also prove that the cup was thrown with enough force to seriously injure the aide.

es.n:
Furthermore, the aide was shown to be minding his own business on the CCTV.

It's difficult to see what reasonable excuse to hurt someone like this would be...
